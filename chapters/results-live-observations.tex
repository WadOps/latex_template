\subsection{Live observations}
In this part, we present the results obtained from our live observations. From the live observations, we were able to identify exactly at which steps users struggle the most. We noticed that the usability of an encryption technology largely depends on its implementation within a mail program, which leads to the fact that the same technology can be laborious to use in one \acrshort{mua} but convenient in another \acrshort{mua}. The following tables contain each step needed to correctly configure and actually use a specific encryption technology in the context of a specific mail program, alongside its difficulty level. We decided to classify the difficulty in 3 levels, depending on the time consumed by our participants to do the step:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Low $\rightarrow$ Less than 5 minutes
	\item Medium $\rightarrow$ Less than 10 minutes
	\item High $\rightarrow$ More than 10 minutes
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Results of \acrshort{pgp}:}
As we can see from the Table \ref{tab:ResultsPGP}, \acrshort{pgp} requires many steps to configure and to use it because the idea of \acrshort{pgp} is to let the user interact completely and get to know how the security of email works. Therefore, demands that users have some knowledge about encryption. We can see that from the step that the users found difficult in every platform tested which is "Get recipient key". This step is mandatory to encrypt the outgoing email and itâ€™s hard for the novice users to apply the concept of asymmetric cryptography. On one hand,, the most difficult email client to use \acrshort{pgp} with is Thunderbird, because not just there are three steps with \textbf{high} difficulty level and it's the bigger number among the other platforms, but also the buttons to get these three configuration steps done are hidden deep in setting menus. One the other hand, FlowCrypt is the easiest to use \acrshort{pgp}, it generates a key-pair for the novice user with only a few clicks and it searches for the recipient key automatically on all key-servers, so FlowCrypt solves the most difficult step for all users. But, it has two inconvenients; it uploads the generated key-pair on its key-server only, which is makes it harder for the other users to find this newly key-pair, and it's only compatible with Gmail webmail.

\subsubsection{Results of \acrshort{pep}:}
We can see from the Table \ref{tab:ResultspEp} that pEp is the easiest technology to use, but it's not (yet) compatible with all platforms. As consequence, we couldn't test it on Apple MacOS or Apple iOS platforms.
