\subsection{Live observations}
In this part, we present the results obtained from our live observations. From the live observations, we were able to identify exactly at which steps users struggle the most. We noticed that the usability of an encryption technology largely depends on its implementation within a mail program, which leads to the fact that the same technology can be laborious to use in one \acrshort{mua} but convenient in another \acrshort{mua}. The following tables contain each step needed to correctly configure and actually use a specific encryption technology in the context of a specific mail program, alongside its difficulty level. We decided to classify the difficulty in 3 levels, depending on the time consumed by our participants to do the step:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Low $\rightarrow$ Less than 5 minutes
	\item Medium $\rightarrow$ Less than 10 minutes
	\item High $\rightarrow$ More than 10 minutes
\end{itemize}
